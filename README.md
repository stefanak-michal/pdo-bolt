# PDO bolt

The PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension defines a lightweight, consistent interface for accessing databases in PHP. This library is dedicated to bolt protocol. This protocol was created by [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) and is used by graph databases like Neo4j, memgraph or Amazon Neptune.

Right now there is no official C/C++ bolt driver and therefore it is not possible to make this library as extension. Even the unofficial driver looks like it is not maintained. Maybe in future it will change but before then you are welcome to use this one.
